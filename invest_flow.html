The flow diagram for the provided code can be described as follows:

1. User opens the HTML file in a web browser.
2. The browser renders the HTML and displays the user interface.
3. User enters their investment query in the input field.
4. User clicks the "Submit" button.
5. The `submitQuery()` function is triggered.
6. The function retrieves the value entered by the user from the input field.
7. The function sends an HTTP POST request to the '/api/investment-guide' endpoint with the user's query as JSON data.
8. The server receives the API request and extracts the query from the request body.
9. The server uses the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo API to generate a response based on the user's query.
10. The server formats the API response and sends it back to the client as JSON data.
11. The client receives the formatted response from the server.
12. The client clears the existing response container on the page.
13. The client iterates through the response points and creates HTML paragraphs for each point.
14. The client appends the paragraphs to the response container, displaying the response on the page.
15. Optionally, the server can handle any errors that occur during the API request and sends an error response to the client.
16. The user can enter another query and repeat the process by clicking the "Submit" button again.

Note: The server code provided is using Express.js and Node.js, so it would require running on a server with Node.js installed to handle the API requests.
